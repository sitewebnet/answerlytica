    <div class="content">
        <p>By accessing or using the Answerlytica platform, users acknowledge that they have read, understood, and accepted these Terms and Conditions in full. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between the User and the Administrator, governing the access, use, and participation in any activities offered through the Platform.</p>
        <p>The Platform is an intellectual property of the Admin and serves as a medium for the posting and answering of research-based questions. It is expressly stated that the Platform is not a betting, gambling, or gaming site, and any inference to the contrary shall be deemed null and void. All activities conducted herein are for academic, educational, and research purposes only.</p>
        <p>The Admin reserves the exclusive and unfettered discretion to post, modify, suspend, or remove any question from the Platform at any time, without prior notice. Likewise, the Admin retains the absolute authority to approve or reject any submitted answer. Rejection may occur in cases where the answer is found to be plagiarized, artificially generated, substandard, or inconsistent with the objectives of the Platform. The Admin is under no obligation to disclose to the User the reasons for such rejection, and the User expressly waives any claim, right, or expectation of explanation in such instances.</p>
        <p>Funds remitted by Users for account upgrades are deemed non-refundable under all circumstances. The act of upgrading an account shall be construed as an acknowledgment of the User's willingness to undertake enhanced research responsibilities and to contribute meaningfully to the knowledge ecosystem fostered by the Platform. No refund shall be issued for payments made towards upgrades, whether or not the User continues to utilize the Platform thereafter.</p>
        <p>The Admin reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to suspend or permanently terminate any User account where activities are reasonably suspected to be fraudulent, unethical, abusive, or otherwise detrimental to the integrity of the Platform. Such termination shall be at the sole discretion of the Admin and shall not attract any liability, refund, or compensation whatsoever.</p>
        <p>All payments, withdrawals, and monetary transactions are subject to internal verification processes. Withdrawals may only be initiated once the User's balance has attained the threshold amount prescribed by the Platform, and payments shall be made exclusively through approved channels, such as M-Pesa. The Admin shall not be liable for delays, reversals, or interruptions caused by third-party financial service providers.</p>
        <p>Personal data collected from Users — including but not limited to email addresses, identification details, and payment information — shall be handled in accordance with the Data Protection Act of Kenya, 2019. Such information shall be used solely for purposes related to account verification, payment processing, and compliance with applicable laws. The Admin undertakes to implement reasonable security safeguards to protect Users' personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. However, the Admin shall not be held liable for breaches arising from events beyond its reasonable control, including cyberattacks, system failures, or third-party misconduct.</p>
        <p>The Admin disclaims all warranties, express or implied, regarding the continuity, reliability, or accuracy of the Platform's content and services. The User acknowledges that participation in the Platform is undertaken voluntarily and at their own risk. The Admin shall not be responsible for any consequential, incidental, or indirect losses arising from use of the Platform, whether due to technical errors, service interruptions, or rejected submissions.</p>
        <p>All disputes, claims, or grievances arising from or in connection with the use of this Platform shall be addressed exclusively through direct communication between the User and the Administrator. The Administrator shall make every reasonable effort, in good faith, to resolve such matters through mutual dialogue and correspondence. The Administrator's determination on any issue, whether relating to payments, account suspension, content rejection, or any other matter pertaining to the operation of the Platform, shall be final and binding. In the event that the User remains dissatisfied with the outcome of such engagement, the User's sole and exclusive remedy shall be to discontinue use of the Platform and terminate their account. For the avoidance of doubt, no arbitration, mediation, or judicial proceedings shall arise from such disagreements, and the Administrator shall bear no legal or financial liability arising from a User's dissatisfaction, perceived loss, or grievance.</p>
        <p>By continuing to use the Platform, the User signifies full agreement to these Terms and Conditions and acknowledges that any breach thereof may result in suspension or permanent termination of their account without notice. These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of Kenya.</p>
